# web-scraping
Really a great exercise here, in which I was introduced to web scraping for the very first time.

There is nothing particular to do for you fellows to test it, just basically clone the repo and install these modules:

```terminal
pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4
```
 There you go ! You only have to run the program, which is only about fetching articles from hackernews based on their scores (at least 100 points). Very simple but so damn cool :):)
